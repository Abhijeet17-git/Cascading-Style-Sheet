    <h2>CSS Overflow Practice</h2>

    <div class="container visible">
        <h3>Visible</h3>
        <p>This content spills out because the box is too small. It overlaps everything below it. This is usually what you DON'T want in a professional layout.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container hidden">
        <h3>Hidden</h3>
        <p>This content is "chopped off." You can't see the rest of the text, and you can't scroll to find it. Useful for images!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container auto">
        <h3>Auto (The Best)</h3>
        <p>The box stays neat! Because the text is too long, a scrollbar appears automatically. This is how chat apps and comment sections work.</p>
    </div>
